#+title: Tutorials on syedra-control Package
#+author: Haldun Komsuoglu


Tutorials folder contains a collection of scripts demonstrating the
use of the package. Each script is a stand alone executable.

The scripts should be executed from the top project folder and from
within the development virtual environment and/or a setup where the
syedra package is installed.

#+begin_src sh
source venv/bin/activate
#+end_src

For instance, the ``tutorial/pid/track.py`` example can be executed
as follows:

#+begin_src sh
python -m tutorials.pid.track
#+end_src
