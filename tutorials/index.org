#+TITLE: Tutorials on syedra Package
#+AUTHOR: Haldun Komsuoglu


Tutorials folder contains a collection of scripts demonstrating the
use of the package. Each script is a stand alone executable.

The scripts should be executed from the top project folder and from
within the development virtual environment and/or a setup where the
syedra package is installed.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
source venv/bin/activate
#+END_SRC

For instance, the ``tutorial/block/wrapper.py`` example can be executed
as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python -m tutorials.block.wrapper
#+END_SRC
