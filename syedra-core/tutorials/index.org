#+title: Tutorials on syedra-core Package
#+author: Haldun Komsuoglu


Tutorials folder contains a collection of scripts demonstrating the
use of the package. Each script is a stand alone executable.

The scripts should be executed from the top project folder and from
within the development virtual environment and/or a setup where the
syedra package is installed.

#+begin_src sh
source venv/bin/activate
#+end_src

For instance, the ``tutorial/block/wrapper.py`` example can be executed
as follows:

#+begin_src sh
python -m tutorials.block.wrapper
#+end_src

  - [[file:block/wrapper.py][wrapper.py]] : basic Block definition as a process wrapper
  - [[file:block/source.py][source.py]] : Block definition with output port
  - [[file:block/sink.py][sink.py]] : Block definition with input port
  - [[file:block/function.py][function.py]] : Block implementing a function between an input and an output
  - [[file:block/periodic.py][periodic.py]] : Block pipeline with feedback producing self excitement
